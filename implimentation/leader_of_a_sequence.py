    A sequence of integers can be formed using integers from 0 to n (inclusive). These numbers want to choose their
    leader, which is a number itself (not necessarily from this sequence). The leader of the sequence
    a0 , a1, a2, ..., anâ€‹ is the following number: "Leader" = (0 xor a0) + (1 xor a1) + ... + (n xor an).
    You are given an integer n. You must generate the sequence of integers (using 0, 1, ..., n) such that
    their leader should be maximal.
